Converts a text file (which may have long text lines) to several forms:

  license.txt - wrapped to 80-column lines (without breaking URLs)
  license-long-lines.txt - same formatting as input except for UTF-8 removal
  license.html - formatted as HTML, with certain lines made into headers

In all cases, UTF-8 character sequences (such as double-quotes) will be
replaced with their ASCII equivalents.

The purpose of this container is to automate the conversion of License texts
into the various necessary forms.

Usage:

  docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/txt couchbasebuild/convert_license_text
     <input file> [ <text file> [ <long-line text file [ <html file> ] ] ]

where <input file> is a text file in the current directory. The output files will
also be placed in the current directory - don't pass absolute paths. If
output filenames aren't specified, "license.txt", "license-long-lines.txt", and
"license.html" will be used.

HINTS:

 - Ensure the input document has no trailing whitespace on lines.
 - Ensure consistent formatting throughout input document; eg. all sections
   should start with "XX. Section Title" and a newline before section body.
